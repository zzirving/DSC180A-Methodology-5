**What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**  
The most interesting thing I learned is the depth of consideration involved with public EV chargers. One example is a reward system for reporting vandalism sounds like a good idea to quickly discover chargers out of service, but realistically it encourages people to vandalize the charger themselves, just to report and claim such rewards. 

**Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**  
I am actually interested to investigate the vandalism/malfunction aspect of EV charger, perhaps forecast its occurances. It will depend if such data is available

**What is a potential change youâ€™d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**  
I wish there are more team works. Right now it is a lot of EDA and individual work, but I think we can benefit from more collaborated efforts. It can also help us get to know each toher's workflow more, and prepare us for Q2.

**What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**  
I really wanted to learn more about graph theory and incorporate it into my project since it is closely related to the positioning of chargers as nodes.
